    "description": "Hi! I'm Sumit Kuswaha, a passionate Full-Stack Developer and a B.Tech Computer Science student in my 6th semester. I love building meaningful tech solutions, whether it's designing sleek frontends with React or creating powerful backends with Node.js and MongoDB.\n\nOver the years, I have gained hands-on experience in Java, Python, C/C++, and have explored areas like Machine Learning and AI, aiming to bridge theory with practical, real-world applications. I'm also continuously learning and contributing to projects that challenge me to grow.\n\nBeyond code, I enjoy chess, singing, and diving into new adventures and languages. My goal? To become a developer who builds not just apps, but experiences."
